=== 🔑 How To Generate/ Add A License Key: ===

Generating and adding a license key is easy. You just need to click ‘Add New’ to generate a new license key. 
Next, follow these five steps:

**1. Select A Product**
Select the desired product from your ‘Add New’ serial key interface. Next, select the right product from the dropdown by entering a few characters of the product name.

**2. Generate Keys**
Add the desired serial/license key from the ‘Serial Numbers’ tab. You could use any combination of letters and numbers to generate serial/license keys. 

**3. Set Activation Limit**
Set the ‘Activation Limit’ of your license key. This mostly applies to software and games licenses. In this section, you can also restrict total activations from the license. For instance, you can enter ‘3’ to allow a maximum of three activations with one key. 

**4. Set Validation Days**
Set key validation days in the ‘Validity’ field. For example, if you desire your license key to stay valid for a whole year, enter 365 in its input bar. It’s worth noting that the countdown starts from the date of purchase. 

**5. Set Expiry Date**
Enter a later date from the calendar in the ‘Expires At’ section. License keys will expire after the date you enter. There will be no allocation to this serial key with future orders after the date expires.  

If your license keys are not for games or software, you can skip options three and four. You can disable this from the Settings menu by clicking the ‘Disable software support’ checkbox.
