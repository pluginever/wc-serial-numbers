## Installation and Usage:

Like most WordPress plugins, the installation of WooCommerce Serial Numbers is very simple and straightforward. If you have any experience of installing a WordPress plugin, there is nothing new for you. Most importantly, you need to have WooCommerce installed and activated on your site. It requires WooCommerce to function properly. [For a detailed installation guide follow our documentation on installation](https://pluginever.com/docs/wocommerce-serial-numbers/installation-of-woocommerce-serial-numbers/?utm_source=product-page-wordpress.org&utm_medium=product-page-wordpress.org&utm_campaign=product-page-wordpress.org).

## How Does It Work:

**WooCommerce Serial Numbers** work for both virtual and downloadable products. First of all, you need to install and activate the plugin to enjoy its features. Once you activate the plugin, you will find a new menu option on your dashboard called Serial Numbers. You will find all the options associated with WooCommerce Serial Numbers under the new menu option.

To license enable or serial enable a product, you need to add serial numbers with that product. Simply add serial numbers with the product following the available options. When a customer purchases a license enabled product, a license key will be added with the order when the order is complete. You can also set orders to auto-complete for your license/serial enabled products. Serial Numbers are displayed on the order confirmation page and also added with the order confirmation email. Your customers will be able to find the serial numbers in their account section under the order details too.

## 🔑 How To Create/Add A License Key:

You will find that adding a license key is very easy. To create a serial number, you need to click on the Add New button to create a new serial number.

👉 First of all, select your desired product from the add new serial number interface. You can select the correct product from the dropdown by typing one or more characters of the product name.

👉 Secondly, you need to add the desired license/serial key from the Serial Number tab. You can use any combination of numbers and letters to make the license/serial key. You can also input multiple lines as your secret key.

👉 Thirdly, you have to deal with the "Activation Limit". This is mostly applicable to software and game licenses. You can restrict the number of activation for the license from this section. For example, you have to enter 1 if you want to allow only a single activation with the key.

👉 Fourthly, comes the "Validity" section. This field takes days as input. If you want your license to be valid for one year then you need to enter 365 here. Note that, the count of days starts from the purchase date.

👉 Finally, comes the "Expires At" option. Enter a date from the pop-up calendar. Serial Numbers will expire after this date and they will not be assigned with any order after this date.

If you are not selling license keys for software or games then, you can ignore the **third** and **fourth** option. You can disable this from the **Settings** section by enabling **Disable Software Support**.
